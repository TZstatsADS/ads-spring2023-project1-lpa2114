### [Project Description](doc/)

Term: Spring 2023

+ Project title: Religion in Philosophy
+ This project is conducted by Luke Arceneaux

+ Project summary: Throughout history, humanity's relationship with religion and different belief systems has been a core part of our internal conflict and identity. It is only natural to look at religion through philisophical schools throughout time. Not only do they often address religion and humanity's relationship with religion on its own, religion is intrinsically connected to and can shape our values, so a school of thought's perspective on religion can unveil other aspects of the school. Through this project, we will utilize philosophical text data and look at how these schools view religion. We will answer questions about how positive or negative they perceive religion and religion adjacent topics, and see what types of perpectives these schools of thought associate with religion.
